Personalized URLs (PURLs) have been an upcoming marketing tactic for a few years now. This technology combines the use of variable printing on direct mail pieces which incorporates a PURL. Recipients of the piece then visit their very own personalized website.

There are many projects out there that use PURLs and they are all rather expensive. This project hopes to make it easier for Django developers to make their own PURLs.
